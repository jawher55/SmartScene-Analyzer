SmartScene Analyzer
=====================

About The Project
-----------------

### Project Overview:
This project aims to address the issue of manually analyzing objects in images by utilizing computer vision and natural language processing to design and develop a SmartScene Analyzer tool.

### Project Background:
The goal of this project is to automate the detection, classification, and contextual analysis of objects in images. It is designed to provide actionable insights and scene understanding for developers, researchers, and tech enthusiasts working on vision-based applications.

### Project Objectives:

**Primary Objective:** Achieve automated object detection and scene commentary by offering a seamless integration of YOLO and LLM technologies.

**Secondary Objective:** Enhance classification accuracy through fine-tuning and retraining on custom datasets.

Project Description
-----------------

**[Project Description:]** This project solves the problem of manual scene analysis by providing an automated tool for object detection and commentary generation. It uses YOLOv8 for object detection, a CNN for classification, and the Ollama Mistral model for generating contextual commentary to achieve efficient and insightful scene analysis. The project's unique features include real-time object detection, automated classification, and natural language commentary generation.

### Why This Project Matters:

**Motivation:** The motivation behind this project is to simplify and accelerate scene understanding for applications in surveillance, autonomous systems, and content analysis.

**Impact:** It helps users by automating the process of identifying and interpreting objects in images, saving time and enabling scalable vision solutions.

Features
--------

**Feature 1:** Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.

**Feature 2:** Automated classification of detected objects with a CNN.

**Feature 3:** Contextual commentary generation using the Ollama Mistral model.

Getting Started
---------------

### Installation

**Step 1:** Install Python 3.8+ and required dependencies:
```bash
python --version
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Step 2:** Install Ollama and configure the environment:

Follow the Ollama Installation Guide to install Ollama and add the Mistral model.
```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

**Step 3:** Clone the repository and run the application:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SmartScene-Analyzer.git
cd SmartScene-Analyzer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Usage
-----

**Step 1:** Launch the server as described in the Installation section and send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/analyze using a tool like Postman:

*   Method: POST
*   Body: multipart/form-data with key `file` and an image (e.g., `temp_test2.jpg`).

**Step 2:** Review the results, which include detected objects, classifications, and commentary.  For detailed implementation, refer to the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-colab-link).
